Mr. Yancey suggests that \"white privilege\" is an empty phrase. He suggests that it may be harmful to whites because it implies that whites are entitled to more than they are entitled to. But if \"white privilege,\" as I understand it, means that whites are treated more favorably than other minorities, then it has the opposite effect from what Mr. Yacyy suggests. Mr.Yancy states that \"white people are less likely to be attacked than other minorities.\" I think that this is a bit of an overstatement.

The point, therefore, is to have a strong, competent government that is able to do that work.\n\nAnd I believe that if a strong, effective government is weak, then it is weak in the sense that it is not able to do its job effectively. I think the vast majority of the American people would agree with that"

By measuring the angle at which the star”s rotation axis turns, the scientists were able to determine the extreme rate at which the AO is rotating.
